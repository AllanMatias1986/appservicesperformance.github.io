# What is an Exception

In the .NET Framework, an exception is an object that inherits from the System.Exception class. An exception is thrown from an area of code where a problem has occurred. 

**Simple words:*** An exception occurs when the application is trying to do something, but it couldnâ€™t.

The exception is passed up the call stack to a place where the application provides code to handle the exception. If the application does not handle the exception, the browser is forced to display the error details.

Most exception objects are instances of some derived class of the Exception class, such as the **SystemException class**, the **IndexOutOfRangeException class,** or the **ArgumentNullException class**. 
The Exception class has properties, such as the **StackTrace property**, the **InnerException property**, and the **Message property**, that provide specific information about the error that has occurred.
